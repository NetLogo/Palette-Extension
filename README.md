# NetLogo Palette Extension

## Building

Use the netlogo.jar.url environment variable to tell sbt which NetLogo.jar to compile against (defaults to NetLogo 5.3). For example:

    sbt -Dnetlogo.jar.url=file:///path/to/NetLogo/target/NetLogo.jar package

If compilation succeeds, `palette.jar` will be created.

## Using the Palette Extension

The NetLogo palette extension offers the user more control over their colors. The colors go beyond NetLogo colors, including ColorBrewer color schemes and arbitrary RGB colors. Additionally, users can control specific components of their color such as alpha, hue and red.

## Getting Started

To get started with palettes add to the top of your Code tab:

```
extensions [palette]
```

you can then call any of the primitives by adding `palette:` before the primitive:

```
palette:hue-of
palette:set-saturation

palette:scale-gradient
palette:scale-scheme
```

## Background
### Review of color representation in NetLogo

#### Colors can be represented as NetLogo colors or RGB or RGBA colors

*	A NetLogo color (NLC or NL color) is a number in the range 0 to 140, with the exception of 140 itself, other values are ‘wrapped.'
    - NetLogo colors are shades of a base color which has units digit 5, and is in the middle of the shade range.
* An RGB color is a list of 3 numbers.
    - The numbers represent red, green and blue and are in the range 0 to 255.
* An RGBA color is a list of 4 numbers.
    - The fourth number is called alpha and is in the range 0 to 255.
    - Alpha represents transparency with 0 fully transparent, and 255 fully opaque.
* RGB/A will be used to denote a color that is either RGB or RGBA.

#### Transparency
The degree to which one can see through a color can also be specified by referring to _transparency_. Transparency is in the range 0 to 100, with 0 fully opaque and 100 fully transparent. Transparency is not stored as part of a color, but is mathematically converted to and from alpha.

#### HSB Color Specification
Colors can also be specified (but not stored as color values) by reference to HSB - hue, saturation and brightness.

* Hue ranges 0 to 360 and forms a cycle.
* Saturation ranges 0 to 100.
* Brightness ranges 0 to 100.
* For more information, search the web for 'hsb color system.'

### More control over the color

Palette primitives allow the user to:

* Report a specific component of a color
    - e.g. palette:hue-of
* Report the result of changing a specific component of a color
    - e.g. palette:with-hue
* Report a specific component of an agent's color
    - e.g. palette:hue
* Change a specific component of an agent's color
    - e.g. palette:set-hue

The user can also create color gradients and access ColorBrewer color schemes.

### Varying an Agent's Transparency or Color

You can make a turtle more transparent by decreasing alpha, or increasing transparency.
A similar approach can be used to adjust color components such as brightness.
Here are two examples:

```
ask turtles [ palette:set-transparency palette:transparency  + 10 ]
ask turtles [ palette:set-alpha .9 * palette:alpha ]
```
Because an error will result if the value passed to a set command is not in the correct range, a little additional code is sometimes needed.
```
ask turtles [ palette:set-transparency min list  100 (palette:transparency + 10) ]
ask turtles [ palette:set-alpha max list 0 (palette:alpha - 25.5) ]
```
### How do I choose a color scheme?

ColorBrewer has three kinds of color schemes: Sequential, Divergent and Qualitative. Although choosing a color palette is a design problem that does not have a single solution we offer the following guidelines for choosing colors for a NetLogo model:

#### Decide first whether to use a Sequential, Divergent or Qualitative color scheme
* Sequential color schemes are best for models of continuous natural phenomena such as as heat diffusion in physics or fire in earth sciences.
* Divergent color schemes are useful for highlighting a middle value in a model. Therefore they could be used with the heat diffusion model if the goal were to highlight regions with the middle temperature.
* Qualitative colors are best for choosing colors in models where color denotes category and not value.

#### Additional color considerations
* For agents that cover large areas avoid strong colors and try to use pastel colors. However, for a few small isolated agents try to use strong colors such as such an accent.
* The main goal is to avoid having a large area covered with agents with a bright color and or having small areas having a muted pastel color.
* If you are coloring both turtles and patches, make sure they have different ranges of hue, saturation and value. For example, use different hues of pastel for patches and accent for turtles.

You can learn more about the use of these color collections in the original ColorBrewer paper (Harrower, Brewer 2003), which focuses on their application to maps. See (Kornhauser, Wilensky, and Rand 1999) for design guidelines for visualization of Agent Based Models.

### Should I use a continuous color gradient or just a discrete color set?

 The answer depends on the focus of the user experience.

 For example, gradients are more aesthetic thus are more memorable than discrete colors. Consequently, a gradient can be a better choice for presentations where the main goal of the image is to be attractive and memorable. However, binning values in a discrete set of colors simplifies tasks such as estimation and counting by removing unnecessary detail and focusing on the big picture. Thus, discrete colors can be a better choice for a written document for which the user will have the time and interest to study the visualization.

 In order to see the difference you can turn on and off the gradient in the Heat Diffusion model. You can observe that turning gradient on makes the model more aesthetic, but it becomes harder to estimate the value of a patch at a given position.

### Example Models

There are a few examples of using the palette primitives in the Code Examples section of the models library:

* Palette Example
* Color Bubbles
* Color Painting
* Color Reveal

And one Sample Model that uses the extension:

* Heat Diffusion - Alternative Gradient

### `palette:scale-gradient`

```NetLogo
palette:scale-gradient rgb-color-list number range1 range2
```


Reports an RGB color proportional to *number* using a gradient generated with _rgb-color-list_. The _rgb-color-list_ is a list containing NL or RGB colors: e.g. [NL1 [r1 g1 b1]  [r2 g2 b2] [r3 g3 b3] NL2 …].

When *range1* is less than or equal to *range2*, the color will be directly mapped to gradient colors. When *range2* is less than *range1*, the color gradient is inverted.

Let *min-range* be the minimum of *range1* and *range2*. If *number* is less than or equal to *min-range*, then the result is the same as if *number* was equal to *min-range*.

Let *max-range* be the maximum of *range1* and *range2*. If *number* is greater than *max-range*, then the result is the same as if *number* was equal to *max-range*.

Example:

```
ask patches
[
  set pcolor palette:scale-gradient [[255 0 0] [0 0 255]] pxcor min-pxcor max-pxcor
]

;; colors each patch with a color proportional to the gradient
```



### `palette:scale-gradient-hsb`

```NetLogo
palette:scale-gradient-hsb rgb-color-list number range1 range2
```


Reports an RGB color equivalent to a color in HSB space proportional to *number* using a gradient generated with _hsb-list_. The _hsb-list_ is a list containing three-element lists of HSB colors: [[h1 s1 b1] [h2 s2 b2] [h3 s3 b3]  …].

When *range1* is less than or equal to *range2*, the HSB color will be directly mapped to gradient HSB colors. When range2 is less than range1, the color gradient is inverted.

Let *min-range* be the minimum of *range1* and *range2*. If *number* is less than or equal to *min-range*, then the result is the same as if *number* was equal to *min-range*.

Let *max-range* be the maximum of *range1* and *range2*. If *number* is greater than *max-range*, then the result is the same as if *number* was equal to *max-range*.


  Example:

  ```
  ask patches
  [
  ask patches [set pcolor palette:scale-gradient-hsb [[200 50 50] [100 60 70]] pxcor min-pxcor max-pxcor]
  ]

  ;; colors each patch with a color proportional to the gradient
  ```
  


### `palette:scheme-colors`

```NetLogo
palette:scheme-colors scheme-type scheme-color number-of-classes
```


Reports a list of RGB colors using ColorBrewer scheme of type *scheme-type* with name *scheme-color* containing *number-of-classes* colors. Scheme types are "Sequential," "Divergent" and "Qualitative." The choice of scheme names depends on the scheme type and includes "Reds", "Spectral" and "Set1". The minimum number of colors is 3 and a maximum is between 8 and 12 depending on the color scheme. For more information go to http://www.colorbrewer.org.

Example:

```
show palette:scheme-colors "Divergent" "Spectral" 3
=> [[252 141 89] [255 255 191] [153 213 148]]


; The scheme-colors primitive can be used with the scale-gradient primitive.
ask patches
  [set pcolor palette:scale-gradient palette:scheme-colors "Divergent" "Spectral" 9 pxcor min-pxcor max-pxcor]
```



### `palette:scale-scheme`

```NetLogo
palette:scale-scheme scheme-type scheme-color number-of-classes number range1 range2
```


Reports an RGB color from the ColorBrewer scheme of type *scheme-type* with name *scheme-color* containing *number-of-classes* colors. The color is chosen using the proportionality of *number* in the range specified by *range1* and *range2*.

When *range1* is less than or equal to *range2*, the colors are ordered as in the ColorBrewer scheme. When *range2* is less than *range1*, the color order is reversed.

Let *min-range* be the minimum of *range1* and *range2*. If *number* is less or equal to than *min-range*, then the result is the same as if *number* was equal to *min-range*. This will be the first color in the color list if *range1* is less than *range2*.

Let *max-range* be the maximum of *range1* and *range2*. If *number* is greater than *max-range*, then the result is the same as if *number* was equal to *max-range*. This will be the last color in the color list if *range1* is less than *range2*.

Example:

```
ask patches
[
  set pcolor palette:scale-scheme "Divergent" "Spectral" 8 pxcor min-pxcor max-pxcor
]

;; colors each patch with a color from the Color Brewer Schemes
```



### `palette:scheme-dialog`

```NetLogo
palette:scheme-dialog
```



Launches a dialog for previewing all the ColorBrewer color schemes.

Use the leftmost pulldown menu to select the scheme type: "Sequential," "Divergent" or "Qualitative." Use the next pulldown menu to select a named scheme. Finally select the number of colors. The maximum number depends on the color scheme. Use the *Copy* button to copy the scheme information into the clipboard. This information can be pasted into commands such as *palette:scheme-colors*. The *Close* button can be used to close the dialog.

Example:

```
  palette:scheme-dialog

  ;; In the dialog the user selects scheme type "Divergent," the scheme named "Spectral," and the number 3, and clicks the *Copy* button.
  ;; In the Command Center the user types "show palette:scheme-colors " and then pastes the clipboard contents, and hits *Enter*.

  show palette:scheme-colors "Divergent" "Spectral" 3

  => [[252 141 89] [255 255 191] [153 213 148]]
```
